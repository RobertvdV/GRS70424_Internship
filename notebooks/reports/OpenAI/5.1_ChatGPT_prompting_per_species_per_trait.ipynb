The leaves often appear whitish from the salt excreted at night and on cloudy days. Leaves are simple and opposite and grow from 2 to 3 inches long. The leaf is oval and pointed, and the margins are entire. The leaves appear smooth, thick, and leathery with a dark green topside and grey to white underside. When the tree is young the bark is smooth and as it matures the bark takes on a thick and fissured texture. The flowers appear at the ends of the branches and are small, white, and fragrant with yellow centers. 9 Altmetric Avicennia germinans (Black Mangrove) is a medium-sized, evergreen shrub or tree with a rounded, densely foliated crown of spreading branches. It bears thick, elliptic, simple and opposite leaves, 2-3 in. long (5-7 cm). Smooth and leathery, they are dark green above and silver-white underneath. Blooming year-round, small white flowers with yellow centers appear in short branched spikes at the tips of the branches. The blossoms are followed by green, fleshy fruits which consist of large flattened capsules of seeds. The bark is dark gray and smooth in youth, becoming scaly on larger trunks.

Flower: White, 4 petaled flowers, occurring in cone-shaped clusters, 1 to 2 inches long near branch tips. Fruit: Egg-shaped capsule 1 to 2 inches long, containing one lima bean-shaped seed. Twig: Stout, slightly angled, finely hairy, and initially green but turning grayish brown. Bark: Dark gray and finely scaly.
