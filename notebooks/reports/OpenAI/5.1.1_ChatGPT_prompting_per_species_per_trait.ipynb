Masses of small air roots 15–45 cm long sometimes hang from upper part of large trunks. Bark dark gray or brown and smooth on small trunks, becoming dark brown, fissured, scaly, and thick. Leaves opposite, lanceolate or narrowly elliptical, 5–11 cm long, 2–4 cm wide, acute or blunt at tip, entire, thick, leathery. Fine hairs giving a grayish hue to foliage; both surfaces often with scattered salt crystals and salty taste. Petiole 3–15 mm long. Spikes or panicles headlike, upright at and near ends of twigs. Flowers several, crowded, sessile, 6 mm long, 10 mm across. Calyx cup-shaped, deeply 5-lobed; corolla tubular, hairy, white but yellowish at base, with 4 slightly unequal spreading, rounded, or notched lobes, stamens 4, 5 mm long in notches of corolla tube near base; pistil with imperfectly 4-celled ovary, slender style, and 2-forked stigma. Capsule elliptical, flattened, 2.5–3 cm long, often splitting into 2 parts. Seed 1, large, flattened, often germinating on tree (Little, 1983). Harvesting Publ\n",
